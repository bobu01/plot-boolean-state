# plot-boolean-state
This is an example notebook to plot boolean state values using matplotlib.axes.Axes.pcolormesh

Use JupyterLab notebook or stand-alone Python to plot a time-series of boolean values. This is similar to signals displayed on an oscilloscope or logic analyzer. This is useful to visualize boolean state variables.  This example plots 16 channels of fake data.  

Matplotlib pcolormesh library is used to plot a numpy array of boolean values. pcolormesh is sometimes used to plot mathematical functions in a "heat map" format. Plotting boolean data is simplified verion of that format. Only 2 colors are used.
